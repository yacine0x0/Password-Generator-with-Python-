# Password-Generator-with-Python

To enhance my knowledge and skills around Algorithms and Compilaton, I started developing this program that, from the title, you can guess what it does.

--- I'm open for any advice or critics ---

Functionalities:

--> Word suggestion:
You can suggest what words you want your password to be generated from + options and tweaks depending on how complicated you want your password to be.

--> Randomizer: Generates a random password from scratch.

--> Password Bank: It creates automatically a password bank (which is a an encrypted file) where all your approved generated passwords are stocked. You will be provided a key to your bank which you should obviously hide somewhere.

!!!SUPER FEATURE!!! : Or if you're that forgetful, you can hit a combination of the "arrow keys" which will be remembered and set as your code to access your bank (this option should be enabled).
